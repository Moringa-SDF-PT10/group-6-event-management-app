# Development Progress Notes & File Index

Hey Team,

Here’s a summary of the frontend and backend work I’ve completed. My main focus was on **Task 1: Core Platform & User Authentication**, but to make the feature fully testable and create a seamless user experience, I also built out the necessary UI components from **Task 3 (Event Creation)** and **Task 5 (Dashboard UI)**.

---

## Npm Packages I've Added

I integrated the following key packages into our React project:

- `react-router-dom`: For all client-side routing.
- `formik` & `yup`: For validated forms for both user registration and event creation.
- `framer-motion`: For fluid animations on the landing page and modals.
- `lucide-react`: For icon set used throughout the app.
- `recharts`: To build the data visualization charts for the organizer's dashboard.

## Features I've Implemented & File Locations

### 1. Core Authentication Flow (Task 1)

I've done the entire end-to-end authentication system, ensuring it was fully connected to the backend API.

- **Global Auth State**: I used a global context to manage the user's session, token, and authentication status across the entire application.  
  `Client/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`

- **Dedicated Auth Page**: Using a dedicated page for login and signup for a more professional flow. It correctly shows the right form based on the URL (`?mode=signup`).  
  `Client/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`

- **Validated Auth Form**: I went for a single, reusable form component using Formik and Yup for both login and registration.  
  *It handles all client-side validation for fields like email, password strength, and matching passwords.  
  `Client/src/components/auth/AuthForm.jsx`

- **Protected Routes**: To secure the dashboard, I implemented a wrapper that redirects any unauthenticated users back to the login page.  
  `Client/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.jsx`

- **Routing Structure**: I set up the main router to handle public and protected pages.  
  `Client/src/App.jsx`

### 2. User Dashboard & Role-Based UI (Task 5)

To test the login and role-based access, I built out a mock dashboard.

- **Main Dashboard Page**: This page acts as a router. It checks the logged-in user's role from the `AuthContext` and renders the correct dashboard layout.  
  `Client/src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx`

- **Organizer Dashboard**: I created a dashboard for organizers complete with stats, charts, and an event list. 
  `Client/src/components/dashboard/OrganizerComponents.jsx`

- **Attendee Dashboard**: I also did a dashboard for attendees that shows their tickets and provides a clear path to discover more events.  
  `Clent/src/components/dashboard/AttendeeComponents.jsx`

- **Shared Header**: I made a reusable header for the dashboard that displays the user's name and includes a working logout button.  
  `Client/src/components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.jsx`

---

### 3. Event Creation UI (Task 3)

To complete the organizer's workflow andf make sure the right components were being rendered, I implemented the UI for creating events.

- **Validated "Create Event" Modal**: I built a modal form for creating new events.  
  *It uses Formik and Yup to validate the inputs, ensuring the **date is in the future** and the **price is a positive number**.  
  `Client/src/components/dashboard/CreateEventModal.jsx`

### Note on Reusability


Feel free to either use the components I've built as-is or design your own. The core business logic (like API calls in AuthContext) is separate from the UI components, so you can easily swap out the front-end pieces without breaking the functionality. I wanted to provide a fully working prototype. Please feel free to adapt the mock UI pages as you see fit for your tasks.
